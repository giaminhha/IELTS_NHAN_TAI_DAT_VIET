STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:  
1. Create **13 questions total**, use only these 4 types of questions **True/False/Not Given, Yes/No/Not Given, Summary Completion, Short Answer**.  
2. **Format**: Each question must be a **JSON object** with fields based on its type:  
***True/False/Not Given or Yes/No/Not Given***
   - "id": unique string identifier (e.g., "Q1")  
   - "question_type": "True/False/Not Given" or "Yes/No/Not Given"
   - "question_text": the full question prompt as shown in IELTS papers  
   - "options": a list of **options** Example: (labeled a) True , b) False , c) Not Given).
   - "rationale": 1–2 sentences explaining why the chosen answer is correct, directly tied to the passage.  


***Summary Completion***
(This example has 2 questions)
{
  "id": "Q1-2",
  "question_type": "Summary Completion",
  "Question_passage": "By the year 1500, printing presses were active in more than 1______ cities and had already produced millions of 2______, an event described as the first 'information explosion'.",
  "answers": {
    "1": "250",
    "2": "books"
  },
  "rationale": {
    "1": "The passage states that presses were operating in over 250 cities by 1500.",
    "2": "The passage states that presses were producing 8 to 20 million books."
  }
}

  "answer": "metal",
  "rationale": "The passage states that Gutenberg’s movable type was made of metal."
}

3. All 13 questions must form a **JSON array**, containing only question objects. No commentary, no text outside the JSON.
4. Questions of the same type **must be placed** next to each other.  
5. Question design rules:  
   - The correct answer must be **directly stated** in the passage (minimal paraphrasing).  
   - Distractors must be **clearly wrong, irrelevant, or too general**. Do not use subtle traps.  
   - Ensure **difficulty matches Part 1 IELTS** (straightforward scanning & locating info, not heavy inference).  
6. Output must be **valid JSON only**. No trailing text, no explanations outside the JSON.
