Text title: Reading Passage

Text: A. The global energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by an escalating imperative to mitigate climate change and establish sustainable energy systems. Traditional fossil fuel reliance, long the bedrock of industrial societies, is being progressively supplanted by a diverse portfolio of renewable energy technologies. This paradigm shift is not merely a technological evolution but a fundamental reorientation of economic and geopolitical priorities. The inherent advantages of renewables, such as their inexhaustible nature and minimal environmental footprint, are increasingly compelling a consensus among nations to accelerate their deployment. The sustained innovation in this sector promises to unlock unprecedented efficiencies and broaden the applicability of these clean energy sources across various societal functions.

Text: B. Among the prominent renewable energy technologies, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have experienced a particularly dramatic expansion. Characterised by their modularity and decreasing cost, PV panels convert sunlight directly into electricity, offering a decentralised power generation solution suitable for both large-scale power plants and residential installations. The efficiency of individual cells has improved substantially over recent decades, with breakthroughs in materials science and manufacturing processes contributing to a significant reduction in the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from solar. This technological maturation has positioned solar PV as a keystone in many national energy strategies, fostering energy independence and reducing reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets.

Text: C. Wind power represents another cornerstone of the global renewable energy infrastructure, leveraging kinetic energy from air currents to drive turbines and generate electricity. Both onshore and offshore wind farms are scaling up considerably, with larger and more efficient turbines capturing greater amounts of energy. Offshore wind, in particular, offers considerable advantages due to stronger, more consistent winds over open water and reduced aesthetic impact compared to land-based installations. However, challenges persist regarding grid integration, particularly the intermittency of both solar and wind power, necessitating sophisticated energy storage solutions and intelligent grid management systems to ensure supply reliability.

Text: D. Hydropower, while a mature and generally reliable renewable source, faces different considerations. Large-scale hydroelectric dams, though capable of providing substantial baseline power, often entail significant ecological and social impacts, including habitat disruption and population displacement. Consequently, the focus for new hydropower development is shifting towards smaller, run-of-the-river projects and upgrading existing facilities to enhance efficiency and minimise environmental disturbance. Geothermal energy, harnessing heat from the Earth's interior, offers a constant, base-load power supply, particularly in geologically active regions. Its geographical limitations and high initial capital expenditure, however, temper its widespread adoption despite its significant potential.

Text: E. The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and the burgeoning demand for reliable energy storage are catalyzing rapid advancements in battery technology. Lithium-ion batteries, currently dominant, are seeing continuous improvements in energy density, charging speed, and cost-effectiveness. Concurrently, research is accelerating into next-generation battery chemistries, such as solid-state and flow batteries, which promise enhanced safety, longer lifespans, and reduced environmental footprints. These innovations are crucial for addressing the intermittency associated with solar and wind power, enabling grid stability, and facilitating the complete decarbonisation of the transportation sector. The integration of smart grid technologies is further optimising energy distribution and consumption patterns.

Text: F. The financial commitment to renewable energy has burgeoned demonstrably over the past two decades. Global investment in new renewable energy capacity, excluding large hydropower, reached approximately $300 billion in 2023, marking a considerable increase from around $50 billion in 2004. This steep ascent reflects both policy support and the decreasing cost competitiveness of renewable technologies compared to conventional generation. Furthermore, the global cumulative installed solar PV capacity surpassed 1.2 terawatts by 2022, a tenfold increase from 2012, while wind power installations have more than tripled in the same period, illustrating the exponential growth trajectory of these key energy sources.

Text: G. Despite these impressive strides, critical challenges remain that require concerted global efforts. The rapid scaling of renewable infrastructure demands significant investment in grid modernisation and expansion to accommodate fluctuating output and enable cross-regional energy sharing. Supply chain vulnerabilities for essential raw materials, particularly rare earth elements and critical minerals for batteries and magnets, represent a geopolitical and economic concern. Moreover, the social equity implications of the energy transition, including potential job displacement in fossil fuel industries and the equitable distribution of benefits from renewable projects, require proactive policies and stakeholder engagement to ensure a just and inclusive transition.

Text: H. Looking ahead, the trajectory of renewable energy technologies appears robust, underpinned by ongoing research and development, supportive regulatory frameworks, and increasing public awareness. Innovations in areas like green hydrogen production, advanced biofuels, and carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) are poised to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. The confluence of technological advancement, favourable economics, and a deepening global commitment to environmental stewardship suggests that renewable energy will not only dominate future energy grids but also drive significant economic growth and foster a more resilient and sustainable global society over the coming decades.
Summary: Renewable energy technologies are rapidly supplanting fossil fuels due to environmental imperatives and technological advancements, though challenges in grid integration and resource supply persist.
