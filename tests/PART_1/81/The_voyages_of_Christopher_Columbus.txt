Text title: Reading Passage

Text: A. In the late fifteenth century, Iberian ambitions converged with new maritime capacities to produce an unprecedented oceanic venture. The Genoese mariner known as Christopher Columbus proposed a westward route to Asia, asserting that the Earth’s circumference was smaller than most scholars allowed. This claim, although provocative, gained traction amid competitive pressures after the conquest of Granada in 1492, when the Spanish Crown sought alternative channels to Asian trade. Consequently, his project was framed not only as exploration but as a commercial strategy designed to reconfigure access to spices, metals, and prestige goods. Subsequent interpretations have oscillated between heroic discovery and destructive conquest, yet the expeditions themselves exposed the ambiguities of early modern navigation, patronage, and empire-building.

Text: B. The intellectual scaffolding for Columbus’s plan drew on medieval cosmography and selective readings of classical authorities. Ptolemaic geography, filtered through later commentators, offered schematic maps where longitudes were poorly constrained. A humanist correspondence with Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli reinforced the premise that Asia lay within practical sailing distance. These ideas were institutionalised in the Capitulations of Santa Fe, which defined Columbus’s titles, revenues, and jurisdiction. The agreement, while lucrative for the navigator, aligned with royal objectives of territorial aggrandisement and fiscal gain. Terms such as latitude—the angular distance north or south of the equator—and longitude—the east–west position relative to a prime meridian—were understood in principle; in practice, however, mariners estimated them imperfectly, thereby conflating scientific aspiration with empirical improvisation.

Text: C. The first voyage, launched from Palos on 3 August 1492, proceeded via the Canary Islands and rode the northeast trade winds across an ostensibly featureless ocean. Three small vessels—the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa María—carried about ninety men for over 3,000 nautical miles before landfall was made in the Bahamas on 12 October. Encounters with Taíno communities involved exchange, miscommunication, and escalating demands for information about gold. A case study of the Santa María’s wreck off Hispaniola on Christmas Day illustrates early settlement fragility: the improvised outpost of La Navidad, built from salvaged timbers, lacked secure provisioning and reliable leadership. When a second expedition returned, the site had been destroyed, suggesting that precarious logistics and coercive interactions undermined any durable coexistence.

Text: D. Expansion, rather than retreat, defined the second voyage of 1493, which assembled 17 ships and over 1,200 passengers, including settlers, clergy, and soldiers. The establishment of La Isabela in early 1494 represented a transition from reconnaissance to colonisation, yet food shortages, disease, and contested authority produced administrative turbulence. Diplomatic geography reshaped the legal context when the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) shifted a papal demarcation line to 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, granting Portugal and Castile segmented spheres of acquisition. Columbus’s third voyage (1498) reached the South American mainland near the Orinoco, while his fourth (1502–1504) probed Central American coasts for a strait that did not exist. Allegations of maladministration culminated in his arrest in 1500, indicating that metropolitan oversight increasingly circumscribed individual discretion.

Text: E. Navigation during these crossings combined dead reckoning—estimating course and distance by speed and direction—with observations of Polaris to approximate latitude. Longitude, by contrast, could not be measured precisely at sea until the eighteenth century; timekeeping and lunar methods were unavailable or unreliable. It has often been noted that Columbus’s distance to Asia was underestimated because he adopted a shorter mile and an inflated width for Eurasia. He posited roughly 2,400 nautical miles between the Canaries and Cipangu (Japan), whereas the actual expanse to East Asia exceeds 10,000 nautical miles. Such computational errors were not merely arithmetic; they regulated expectations, provisioning schedules, and risk assessments. Misidentification followed: Cuba was reported as part of the Asian mainland, a conclusion sustained by oath-bound testimony rather than by conclusive observation.

Text: F. The ecological and demographic consequences of contact were profound, constituting what later historians termed the Columbian Exchange. New crops such as maize and cassava entered European and African diets, while horses, cattle, and pigs transformed Caribbean landscapes and labor systems. More consequentially, pathogens moved asymmetrically. Hispaniola’s Indigenous population—estimated by scholars to number in the hundreds of thousands in 1492—declined precipitously within two decades; by around the 1510s, contemporary reports indicate only tens of thousands remained. Causation is debated: epidemic disease, coercive labor in the encomienda system (a grant of labor and tribute to colonists), famine, and social dislocation interacted in complex ways. Plantation sugar, introduced soon after, institutionalised environmental alteration and entrenched extractive economic structures.

Text: G. Interpretations of Columbus’s legacy have shifted markedly, particularly around the 1892 and 1992 commemorations. Early nationalist narratives emphasised daring seamanship and entrepreneurial initiative; later analyses incorporated Indigenous perspectives, legal arguments about sovereignty, and attention to structural violence. Museums and school curricula now juxtapose navigational ingenuity with colonial expropriation, thereby questioning the language of “discovery”. Nevertheless, the voyages catalysed cartographic innovation, integrated Atlantic circuits, and provided a template for imperial governance. Castilian expansion facilitated missionary activity, judicial experimentation, and a reorientation of European commerce that would later include American silver. The complexity resides in simultaneity: innovation and exploitation advanced together, and celebratory rhetoric often obscured the contingent, sometimes chaotic, texture of events on the ground.

Text: H. Reassessment, therefore, treats the voyages less as singular triumphs than as contingent enterprises shaped by miscalculation, negotiation, and evolving legal frameworks. The expeditions accelerated a global realignment, connecting biotas, markets, and polities in ways that could neither be controlled nor fully anticipated. Notwithstanding the navigator’s personal ambitions, institutional constraints and Atlantic ecologies determined outcomes to an unusual degree. While maritime techniques and political bargains made oceanic crossings feasible, the consequences—demographic collapse, ecological transplants, and new regimes of labor—extended far beyond initial intent. The Columbian episode thus functions as a case of system-level transformation, in which discrete decisions, partial knowledge, and competitive empires collectively produced a durable, if contested, world order.

Summary: Columbus’s westward ventures, grounded in flawed geography yet enabled by state power, inaugurated enduring ecological, economic, and political transformations.

Text: Questions

1. What most influenced the Spanish Crown’s decision to support Columbus’s westward proposal in 1492?
... The passage states that competitive pressures after Granada’s conquest led Spain to pursue alternative routes to Asian trade. Other options either reverse chronology, use absolutes, or oversimplify the rationale.
a) A. Heightened rivalry after the fall of Granada pushed the monarchy to seek new avenues to Asian commerce.
b) B. Universal scholarly agreement that the Earth was far smaller than previously thought.
c) C. The voyages had already transformed Europe’s spice trade, proving the plan’s profitability.
d) D. Columbus’s claim about a smaller Earth alone persuaded the monarchs, independent of trade concerns.

2. Which best explains why Columbus underestimated the distance from the Canary Islands to Asia?
... The passage attributes his underestimate to adopting a short mile and an oversized Eurasia. The other options misstate period techniques or confuse pre-voyage calculations with at-sea errors.
a) A. He combined an inflated estimate of Eurasia’s width with a shorter mile, making the Atlantic seem compressed.
b) B. Latitude could not be estimated because observations of Polaris were unavailable to mariners.
c) C. Precise timekeepers let him calculate longitude exactly, causing him to shorten the route.
d) D. Dead-reckoning mistakes during the first crossing reduced the measured distance even before departure.

3. According to the passage, what best accounts for the rapid decline of Hispaniola’s Indigenous population within two decades of 1492?
... The text cites a multifactor interplay—disease, forced labor, famine, and dislocation—as driving the decline. Other options rely on absolutes or reverse/deny the stated effects.
a) A. Interacting factors including epidemic disease, coercive labor, famine, and social disruption.
b) B. Only the immediate spread of plantation sugar eliminated most communities.
c) C. European immigration directly increased Indigenous numbers through sustained protection and aid.
d) D. The Taíno consistently avoided all contact, preventing disease transmission entirely.
