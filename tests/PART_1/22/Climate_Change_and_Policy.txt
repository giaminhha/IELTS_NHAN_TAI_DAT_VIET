Text title: Reading Passage

Text: A. The escalating phenomenon of anthropogenic climate change poses an unprecedented threat to global ecosystems, human societies, and economic stability. Evidence of a rapidly warming planet, primarily attributed to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, is now irrefutable. Scientific consensus, underpinned by extensive research from bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), unequivocally points to human activities – particularly the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and land-use changes – as the predominant drivers of this alteration. The resultant impacts, including more frequent and intense extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss, necessitate urgent and coordinated global policy responses to avert catastrophic future scenarios and safeguard planetary habitability.

Text: B. Historically, initial international efforts to address climate change were largely informed by growing scientific understanding and public concern. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in 1992, established the foundational architecture for multilateral action, aiming to stabilise GHG concentrations "at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." This landmark agreement recognised the common but differentiated responsibilities of nations, acknowledging that developed countries, having contributed most to historical emissions, bear a greater obligation in leading mitigation efforts. However, the subsequent Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, which set legally binding emissions targets for developed nations, faced challenges related to ratification and compliance from several major emitters.

Text: C. A significant evolution in climate policy manifested with the Paris Agreement in 2015, which represented a paradigm shift from a top-down, target-setting approach to a more inclusive, bottom-up framework. Under this accord, 196 parties committed to formulating and submitting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – self-defined climate action plans to reduce emissions and adapt to climate impacts. A central objective is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while actively pursuing efforts to restrict the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This universal agreement underscored the principle of collective action, requiring all signatory nations, irrespective of their development status, to contribute to the global effort.

Text: D. The implementation of climate policies at national and sub-national levels typically involves a diverse portfolio of instruments. Carbon pricing mechanisms, such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, are increasingly prevalent, aiming to internalise the external costs of emissions and incentivise cleaner technologies. Regulatory standards, including fuel efficiency mandates for vehicles and energy performance standards for buildings, also play a crucial role in curbing emissions from key sectors. Furthermore, significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure, alongside incentives for energy efficiency and sustainable land management practices, are vital components of comprehensive climate strategies. These interwoven approaches are designed to foster a transition away from fossil fuel dependency towards a decarbonised economy.

Text: E. Despite the widespread commitment articulated in international agreements, a persistent gap remains between current policy ambition and the scale of action required to meet the Paris Agreement targets. Projections from the United Nations Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report consistently highlight this deficiency, indicating that existing NDCs are insufficient to keep global warming within the 1.5°C limit. For instance, the 2023 report indicated that current policies and commitments place the world on track for a 2.5-2.9°C warming by the end of this century, far exceeding the desired threshold. This disparity underscores the urgent need for enhanced ambition, robust implementation mechanisms, and greater financial flows to support climate action, especially in developing countries grappling with both mitigation and adaptation challenges.

Text: F. Case studies of successful policy implementation offer valuable insights. The European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), operational since 2005, stands as the world's largest carbon market, covering roughly 40% of the bloc's GHG emissions. It has demonstrably contributed to emission reductions in covered sectors, albeit with fluctuating carbon prices. Costa Rica, on the other hand, exemplifies a nation that has made significant strides towards decarbonisation, aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 through extensive reforestation efforts, a high proportion of renewable electricity generation (often exceeding 98%), and policies promoting electric vehicles. These diverse examples illustrate that tailored approaches congruent with national circumstances can yield substantial progress.

Text: G. Addressing climate change also entails confronting the often-overlooked dimension of climate adaptation. While mitigation focuses on reducing emissions to prevent warming, adaptation involves adjusting to the actual or expected future climate. This includes developing resilient infrastructure, implementing early warning systems for extreme weather events, and shifting agricultural practices to cope with altered conditions. Funding for adaptation, particularly for vulnerable developing nations, remains a critical challenge, despite its paramount importance. International agreements acknowledge the need for a balanced approach to mitigation and adaptation, recognising that both are indispensable for building a truly climate-resilient global society.

Text: H. The future trajectory of climate policy is likely to be characterised by increased emphasis on technological innovation, climate finance, and strengthened international accountability mechanisms. Breakthroughs in carbon capture technologies, sustainable agriculture, and advanced renewable energy solutions are crucial for accelerating decarbonisation. Simultaneously, the mobilisation of significant financial resources, both public and private, is essential to fund the transition in developing nations and support ambitious climate projects globally. Furthermore, robust monitoring, reporting, and verification frameworks are paramount to ensure transparency and uphold the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, thereby fostering collective progress towards a sustainable and climate-stable future.
Summary: Climate change necessitates urgent global policy action, which has evolved from initial frameworks to more inclusive agreements like the Paris Agreement, demanding diverse mitigation and adaptation strategies despite persistent implementation gaps.

Text: Questions

1. What is identified as the primary reason for the rapid warming of the planet?

a) A) Natural climatic cycles and volcanic activity.
b) B) Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases due to human activities.
c) C) Solar flares and changes in the Earth's orbit.
d) D) Deforestation and agricultural practices alone.

2. How did the Paris Agreement fundamentally differ from previous climate policy approaches like the Kyoto Protocol?
... Paragraph C explicitly states, 'A significant evolution in climate policy manifested with the Paris Agreement in 2015, which represented a paradigm shift from a top-down, target-setting approach to a more inclusive, bottom-up framework.'
a) A) It introduced legally binding emissions targets for all nations globally.
