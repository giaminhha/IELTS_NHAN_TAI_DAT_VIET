The imperative to transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources has never been more pronounced. Driven by mounting concerns over climate change, energy security, and environmental degradation, the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies have gained considerable momentum globally. These technologies harness naturally replenishing sources such as sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat, offering a robust alternative to conventional carbon-intensive methods of power generation. The paradigm shift towards renewables is not merely an environmental desideratum but also an economic opportunity, fostering innovation and creating new industries, thereby mitigating the often-cited trade-off between economic growth and environmental stewardship.\n\nText: B. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems represent a cornerstone of this renewable energy revolution. They convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials, a process known as the photovoltaic effect. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of PV modules have dramatically improved in recent decades, facilitating their widespread adoption. Beyond grid-scale installations, distributed generation through rooftop solar panels empowers individual consumers and promotes energy independence. However, the intermittent nature of solar power, dependent on daylight hours and weather conditions, necessitates sophisticated energy storage solutions and smart grid infrastructure to ensure grid stability and reliability.\n\nText: C. Wind power, another prominent renewable resource, harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air through large turbines. Modern wind turbines have become increasingly sophisticated, with advanced aerodynamic designs and control systems that optimise energy capture across a range of wind speeds. Offshore wind farms, in particular, offer significant potential due to stronger and more consistent winds, mitigating some of the land-use constraints and visual impact issues associated with onshore installations. Despite their advantages, concerns pertinent to avian mortality, noise pollution, and the aesthetic impact on landscapes remain subjects of ongoing research and mitigation efforts.\n\nText: D. Hydropower, the conversion of energy from flowing water into electricity, stands as the most mature and widely utilised renewable energy technology globally, contributing significantly to national grids. Large-scale hydroelectric dams typically offer a reliable and dispatchable power source, capable of rapid response to fluctuations in demand. However, their construction often entails substantial environmental and social costs, including habitat fragmentation, altered river ecosystems, and displacement of communities. Run-of-river schemes and small-scale hydro installations provide less impactful alternatives, though they may offer less storage capacity and power generation.\n\nText: E. Geothermal energy taps into the Earth's internal heat, a virtually inexhaustible resource. Geothermal power plants extract steam or hot water from underground reservoirs to drive turbines and generate electricity. This technology offers a consistent, baseload power supply, unaffected by weather patterns. Regions with high geothermal activity, such as Iceland and the Philippines, significantly derive a substantial portion of their electricity from this source. Nevertheless, geographical specificity limits its widespread applicability, and initial drilling costs can be considerable, posing financial barriers to entry in new markets.\n\nText: F. Bioenergy, derived from organic matter such as agricultural waste, dedicated energy crops, and sewage, offers diverse pathways for energy production. It can be converted into electricity, heat, or biofuels for transportation. Biomass combustion facilities generate electricity and heat, while anaerobic digestion produces biogas. This sector has the potential to contribute to waste management and rural development. However, sustainable bioenergy development requires careful consideration of land use, potential impacts on food security, and the overall lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions to ensure genuine environmental benefits.\n\nText: G. The global investment in renewable energy continues to escalate, reflecting growing confidence in its economic viability and environmental necessity. In 2022, global renewable energy capacity additions reached approximately 295 gigawatts (GW), increasing overall capacity by 9.6% from the previous year, with solar PV accounting for over half of this growth. Projections indicate that by 2030, renewable energy could contribute over 60% of the world's electricity generation, surpassing fossil fuels as the primary source. This trajectory is underpinned by declining technology costs, supportive policy frameworks, and increasing energy demand from developing economies. However, grid modernization, energy storage solutions, and international cooperation remain critical for fully realising this potential.\n\nText: H. Overcoming the inherent challenges associated with renewable energy integration requires a multi-faceted approach. These include addressing intermittency through advanced battery storage, pumped-hydro storage, and flexible grid management systems. Policy instruments, such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and carbon pricing, are pivotal in fostering investment and accelerating deployment. Furthermore, sustained research and development in areas like advanced materials for solar cells, more efficient wind turbine designs, and novel energy storage chemistries are crucial for enhancing performance and reducing costs further. Public acceptance, often influenced by perceived environmental impacts and economic benefits, also plays a significant role in successful project implementation.\n\nSummary: Renewable energy technologies offer diverse and increasingly viable solutions to global energy demands, but require continued innovation, policy support, and infrastructure development to achieve full potential.",
